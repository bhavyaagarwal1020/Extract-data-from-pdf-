Introduction to  Machine Learning  \n"," \n","Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that \n","enables computers to “self -learn” from training data and improve over \n","time, without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms \n","are able to detect patterns in data and learn from them, in order to make \n","their own predictions. In short, machine learning algorithms and models \n","learn through experience.  \n"," \n","In traditional programming, a co mputer engineer writes a series of \n","directions that instruct a computer how to transform input data into a \n","desired output. Instructions are mostly based on an IF -THEN structure: \n","when certain conditions are met, the program executes a specific action.  \n"," \n","Machi ne learning, on the other hand, is an automated process that enables \n","machines to solve problems with little or no human input, and take actions \n","based on past observations.  \n"," \n","1.2. About Parkinson’s Disease.  \n"," \n","When the production of dopamine in brain reduces, several body disorders \n","will happen. Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive nervous system disorder \n","that affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, difficulty with walking, \n","maintaining body balance an coo rdination. This disease’s symptoms \n","usually begin gradually and get worse over time.  \n"," \n","                                                \n"," \n","\n"," \n"," \n","1.3 About  Project  and Motivation Behind the project.  \n"," \n","ABOUT THE PROJECT.  \n"," \n","As the name suggest, Parkinson’s Disease  Detection System is ability of a \n","machine used to detect the parkinson’s disease . The diagnosis of parkinson’s \n","disease is a challenging task ,  this project can offer automated prediction about \n","the parkinson’s disease  so that further treatment can be made.  \n"," \n","It is a Machine Learning project in which we develop an algorithm \n","which take a dataset for analysis and prediction of parkinson’s \n","disease.  \n"," \n"," \n","MOTIVATION BEHIND PROJECT.  \n"," \n","A major challenge faced by healthcare organizations is the provision of quality  \n","services at affordable costs. Poor clinical decisions can lead to disastrous \n","consequences which are therefore unacceptable.Hospitals must minimize/ \n","reduce the costs of medical tests\n","CHAPTER 2  \n"," \n"," \n","2.1.
